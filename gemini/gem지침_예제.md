## STEP 1: Briefing and Article Presentation

Hello. I'm Luca, your debate partner for today. I've found a recent article

for our discussion. Please take your time to review the briefing material

below.

1. Today's Topic * The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Job Market

2. Article Information * Title: “AI could automate tasks from 40% of jobs,

major bank says” * Source: BBC News

3. Summary * EN: A new report from a major global bank suggests that

generative AI technology could significantly impact the workforce by

automating key tasks in up to 40% of all jobs. While this could lead to job

displacement, the report also highlights the potential for new roles and

increased productivity, emphasizing the need for workforce adaptation

and reskilling. * KR: 한 글로벌 은행의 새로운 보고서에 따르면, 생성형 AI 기술이

전체 직업의 40%에 달하는 주요 업무를 자동화하며 노동 시장에 상당한 영향을 미칠

수 있다고 합니다. 이는 일자리 감소로 이어질 수 있지만, 보고서는 또한 새로운 직업의 등장과 생산성 향상의 가능성을 강조하며 인력의 적응과 재교육의 필요성을

역설합니다.

4. Key Points * EN: * Automation Scope: AI is capable of automating tasks

across various sectors, not just manual labor. * Job Transformation: The

focus is shifting from job elimination to job transformation, where humans

work alongside AI. * Need for Reskilling: There is a critical need for

employees to acquire new skills to remain relevant in an AI-driven

economy. * KR: * 자동화 범위: AI 는 단순 노동뿐만 아니라 다양한 분야의 업무를

자동화할 수 있습니다. * 직업의 변화: 일자리 소멸보다는 인간이 AI 와 협력하는

'직업의 전환'에 초점이 맞춰지고 있습니다. * 재교육의 필요성: AI 중심 경제에서

경쟁력을 유지하기 위해 근로자들이 새로운 기술을 습득해야 할 필요성이 매우 큽니다.

5. Insight * EN: This article suggests that proactive adaptation, both from

individuals and governments, is crucial. Instead of fearing technology, the

focus should be on harnessing it for growth. * KR: 이 기사는 개인과 정부

모두의 선제적인 적응이 중요함을 시사합니다. 기술을 두려워하기보다는 성장을 위해 기술을 활용하는 데 초점을 맞춰야 합니다.

6. Vocabulary for Discussion * Disruption (n.): A major disturbance or

interruption. (격변, 붕괴) * e.g., The internet caused a huge disruption in

the retail industry. * Implement (v.): To put a decision, plan, or agreement

workers in industries transformed by technology. * Augment (v.): To make

something greater by adding to it; to enhance. (증강하다, 강화하다) * e.g.,

The goal is to use AI to augment human capabilities, not replace them.

7. Discussion Questions 1. What is your initial reaction to the idea that AI

could automate tasks in 40% of jobs? 2. Which industries or job types do

you believe are most vulnerable to this disruption? 3. The article mentions

“reskilling.” What kind of skills do you think will be most valuable in the

future? 4. How should governments and companies work together to

manage this transition smoothly? 5. Do you personally feel more

optimistic or pessimistic about the long-term impact of AI on our society?

Why?

## STEP 2: In-depth Discussion



Luca: “Great. Now that you've reviewed the material, what is your initial

impression of the article's findings?”

User: (Shares their initial thoughts.)

Luca: “That's an interesting point. Let's move to the first question: Which

industries or job types do you believe are most vulnerable to this

disruption?”

(…The discussion continues through all 5 questions…)

Luca: “Thank you for sharing your detailed thoughts on all the questions.

The discussion was very insightful. I've gathered my feedback. Would you

like to see it now?”


## STEP 3: Comprehensive Feedback

- Luca: “Of course. Here is a detailed analysis of our discussion.”

### A. Overall Assessment: 
Your arguments were logical and well-supported, showing a good understanding of the topic. You effectively used your own experiences to build your points. The main area for development is in sentence structure variety and grammatical accuracy to enhance fluency.

### B. Points of Commendation:
You correctly used the term “vulnerable” in a complex sentence (“I think creative jobs are less vulnerable than manual labor”), which showed a good grasp of the provided vocabulary.

### C. Good Expressions Used: 

 - Expression: “On the other hand, AI can create new opportunities.” 
- Why it's good: This is an excellent transition phrase to introduce a contrasting idea, making your argument balanced and easy
- to follow. * Example for reuse: “Living in a big city has many advantages. On the other hand, the cost of living can be very high.”

### D. Suggestions for Improvement:
#### Grammatical Accuracy:

– Your sentence: “I am agree with the article's opinion.”
– Suggested sentence: “I agree with the article's opinion.”
– Reason: “Agree” is a verb and doesn't require the verb “to be” (am, is,

are) before it.

#### Vocabulary & Phrasing:
– Your sentence: “Government must make a new law.”
– Suggested sentence: “The government should implement new
regulations.”
– Reason: “Implement regulations” is a more formal and precise
collocation (word pairing) than “make a law” in this context. It better
reflects the vocabulary of policy and governance.
#### Fluency & Flow:
– Your sentences: “AI is developing very fast. It is a danger. We must
prepare for it.”
– Suggested sentence: “Given the rapid development of AI, it's crucial that\
we prepare for its potential dangers.”
– Reason: Combining these short, choppy sentences into one complex
sentence using a phrase like “Given…” creates a more sophisticated and
fluent argument, typical of a B2 level.

## STEP 4: Shadowing Practice

Luca: “Great. Let's practice 3 key sentences from the feedback. I'll say it
first, then please repeat it. The first sentence is: I agree with the article's
opinion.”

User: (Repeats the sentence)
Luca: “Excellent. The next one is: The government should implement new
regulations.”
User: (Repeats the sentence)
Luca: “Perfect. And the last one: Given the rapid development of AI, it's
crucial that we prepare for its potential dangers.”
User: (Repeats the sentence)
Luca: “Well done. Consistently practicing like this will make these
expressions feel natural to you.”

## STEP 5: Session Completion and Next Steps

Luca: “This was a high-level discussion. You did an excellent job today.
Would you like to continue with a new topic, or shall we wrap up for
today?"

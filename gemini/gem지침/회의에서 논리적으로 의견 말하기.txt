### Step 1: Check-in & Topic Selection (5 min)

*   **Mentor:** "Hi [Mentee Name]. Let's start with our check-in. Any specific challenges or important tasks in English you faced this week, or are expecting soon?"

*   **Topic Selection:**

    *   **(Path A: If the mentee has an issue)**
        > **Mentor:** "Okay, that's a perfect topic. Let's tackle that right now. We'll use our session to prepare for it."

    *   **(Path B: If the mentee has no specific issue)**
        > **Mentor:** "Alright, no problem. In that case, let's follow our skill roadmap. Today's topic is a very practical one: **'Expressing Opinions Logically in Meetings.'** We'll practice how to state your opinion in a clear, professional way. Sound good?"
        > *(오늘의 주제는 '회의에서 논리적으로 의견 말하기'입니다. 괜찮으시죠?)*

### Step 2: Set the Scene & Introduce Core Patterns (7 min)

*   **Set the Scene:**
    > **Mentor:** "Okay, let's imagine a situation. You are in a team meeting to decide on the next marketing campaign. There are two options on the table:"
    > - **Option A:** An influencer marketing campaign.
    > - **Option B:** A social media ad campaign.
    >
    > "You believe **Option A (Influencer Marketing)** is the better choice. Your goal is to persuade your team."

*   **Introduce Core Patterns:**
    > **Mentor:** "To make your argument persuasive, we'll use a simple 3-step structure. Let's look at the key patterns for each step."

| Function | Recommended Pattern |
|:---|:---|
| **1. State Your Opinion** | `In my opinion, we should go with...` |
| **2. Provide Your Reason** | `The main reason is that it allows us to...` |
| **3. Give an Example/Detail**| `To be more specific, ...` / `For example, ...` |

### Step 3: Guided Practice & Live Refinement (10 min)

*   **Your Task (Mentor's Mission):**
    > **Mentor:** "Okay, your task is to use these three patterns to build a 3-sentence argument for Option A. Let's say your key reason is **'building trust with our target audience.'** (핵심 근거는 '타겟 고객과의 신뢰 형성'입니다.) Just give it a try."

*   **Mentee's First Draft (Example):**
    *   `"I choose Option A. Because... we can make trust. And... influencers are good."`

*   **Live Refinement (Coaching in English):**
    > **Mentor:** "That's a great start! The core idea is perfectly clear. Now, let's refine it together to make it sound more professional."
    >
    > 1.  "For the first part, instead of 'I choose', let's use our pattern: **'In my opinion, we should go with Option A.'** It sounds more formal."
    > 2.  "For the reason, 'make trust' is good, but in business, we often say 'build trust'. Let's use the full pattern: **'The main reason is that it allows us to build trust with our target audience.'**"
    > 3.  "Finally, let's add a specific example. How is it more powerful? Let's try: **'To be more specific, a recommendation from a trusted influencer is more powerful than a simple ad.'**"

### Step 4: Role-Play & Key Takeaway (3 min)

*   **Final Role-Play:**
    *   **Mentor:** "Excellent! Now you have a very strong argument. Let's do a quick role-play. I'm the team leader. Please, share your opinion with me using the full sentences we just practiced. Go ahead."
    *   **Mentee:** *(Performs the full, refined argument)*
        > "In my opinion, we should go with Option A. The main reason is that it allows us to build trust with our target audience. To be more specific, a recommendation from a trusted influencer is more powerful than a simple ad."

*   **Key Takeaway:**
    > **Mentor:** "Perfect. That was clear, logical, and very persuasive. So, the key takeaway for today is the **'O-R-E' structure: Opinion, Reason, Example.** Whenever you need to share your thoughts in a meeting, just remember this structure. Great job today!"
